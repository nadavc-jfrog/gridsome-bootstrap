    <h2>What is Build&nbsp;Info</h2>
    <p>Simply put Build Info is a label used to describe all the details about the build. Broken down into segments the build is a version of a program; and the info is all of the details contained within the build - artifacts, project modules, dependencies - all of the items that create the build itself. When you put the two together you get a detailed view of your code and the components that created it. It is a snapshot into the inner workings of your code.</p>

    <h2>Why Do I Care</h2>
    <p>Open Source Software is amazing but it is not without its faults or vulnerabilities. Free code can make your build run smoothly but it can also contain active threats to your project, code, business, customers, and overall software environment. This has been proven time and time again with the recent hacks to SolarWinds, the Colonial Pipeline Hack, Equifax and many others. This is why you should care about build info. Knowing what metadata is contained within your build can help you identify known vulnerabilities and malicious code. This is one of the many reasons why we are so happy to be able to share Build Info with you - so you can have one more layer of security to your code.</p>

    <h2>How Do I Get Build Info?</h2>
    <p>JFrog co-founder and CTO, Yoav Landman realized the need for developers and companies to review and evaluate their build on the meta level. One of the core features of JFrogâ€™s flagship tool, Artifactory, is build-info. JFrog is committed to being a community first company and these recent attacks and the increased sophistication of malicious hackers was a catalyst for Yoav to decide to break out Build-Info from Artifactory and offer it as an open source solution to reviewing the metadata in your build. Running our open source version of Build Info will allow you to download JSON file that gives you all of the relevant information you need to secure your code. </p>
