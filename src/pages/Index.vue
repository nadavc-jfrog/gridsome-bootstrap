    <h2>What is Build Info</h2>
    <p>Simply put Build Info is a label used to describe all the details about the build. Broken down into segments the build is a version of a program; and the info is all of the details contained within the build - artifacts, project modules, dependencies - all of the items that create the build itself. When you put the two together you get a detailed view of your code and the components that created it. It is a snapshot into the inner workings of your code.</p>
